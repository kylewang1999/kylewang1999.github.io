I'm a computer science Master's student at UC San Diego with a specialized focus in computer vision and robotics, applying for PhD positions starting Fall 2024. My ongoing and past projects span topics including deformable tissue tracking, 6 DoF pose estimation, semantic segmentation, GANs, and advanced rendering techniques.

I like to document my studying progress and post my notes. Please see the ['learn with me'](./learn_with_me.md) section for my notes.

## Research

I'm working on improving deformable tissue reconstruction in a[surgical perception framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05405), aiming for RA-L submission.

Please stay tuned. ðŸ˜‡
