I'm a researcher-want-to-be, who's interested in deep learning and computer vision.


## News (WI22)

What I intend to work on in the following 2-3 months.

**Coursework in progress**:

- CSE251B Neural network and pattern recognition.
- CSE203B Convex optimization. 
- [CSE167](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~alchern/teaching/cse167_2021/) Intro to computer graphics. (Yes, yes I'm a graduate student taking an undergrad class ...)

**Beyond the class room**: (Coursework is lots of load already. Let me think about this...)








## Non-academic Aspect

Yes, a CS graduate student can have a life! (except when they cannot...)

I'm an active person and a basketball lover. I usually play at either Main Gym or RIMAC in the afternoon: join me and have a couple of nice runs! ([open rec hours](https://recreation.ucsd.edu/open-rec/)).
