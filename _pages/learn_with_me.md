Sharing my learning journey with all of you!

Previously I was using OneNote for note-taking. It is easy-to-use but very inconvenient for publishing. I am transitioning 
towards [MarkDown](https://www.markdownguide.org)-based note-taking, and I'll try posting as much of them as possible right here.
